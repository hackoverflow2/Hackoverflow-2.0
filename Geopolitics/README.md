## 2. Geographical conflicts - *(Geopolitics)* ##
Land degradation affects 3.2 billion people and costs the global economy around 10% of its GDP annually. Despite pledges from nations to restore 350 million hectares of degraded land, effective execution is hindered by land disputes. A scalable solution is needed to address this issue, as more than 3 million people are impacted by land conflicts in India alone. Using AI and socio-economic data, it is possible to identify and assess the underlying causes of these conflicts and suggest realistic solutions. Furthermore, it is crucial to understand how these issues can be forecasted in the future and how to reduce their economic impact.
