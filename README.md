The problem statements for your 48 hour development period are as follows. Let the coding begin!!

## 1. Preventing wastage by sales prediction - *(Food Management)* ##
Today, the globe wastes or loses nearly a third of the food it generates, while approximately 690 million people remain hungry. If we keep throwing away 1/3 of the produced food, weâ€™ll need 2 planets to feed 10 billion people in 2050. Reusing and recycling food waste is only a portion of the answer. Itâ€™s the prevention that we need most to achieve a sustainable food future. On the basis of past logs of ration shops and food suppliers, we can understand the consumption patterns. Similarly, with the past municipality logs and waste analysis of fast-running restaurants, we can understand the wastage on a periodic basis. Given these examples as references, you can explore more such datasets to broaden your horizon and come up with a sustainable solution for this problem by incorporating AI.

## 2. Geographical conflicts - *(Geopolitics)* ##
Land degradation affects 3.2 billion people and costs the global economy around 10% of its GDP annually. Despite pledges from nations to restore 350 million hectares of degraded land, effective execution is hindered by land disputes. A scalable solution is needed to address this issue, as more than 3 million people are impacted by land conflicts in India alone. Using AI and socio-economic data, it is possible to identify and assess the underlying causes of these conflicts and suggest realistic solutions. Furthermore, it is crucial to understand how these issues can be forecasted in the future and how to reduce their economic impact.

## 3. Malaria Control using AI - *(BioTech)* ##

## 4.Crop Guidance and Farmers Friend - *(BioTech)* ##
The needs of contemporary agriculture, which demands high-yield, high-quality, and efficient production, cannot be met by conventional agricultural practices. Furthermore, farmers face the main challenge of how to adapt to changing customer preferences. It is critical to modernize existing processes and use data acquired over time to determine the best potential farming practices that should be implemented. Develop a solution that uses the potential of AI to address this problem.

## 5. Catastrophic disasters in Africa - *(Environment)* ##
Natural disasters such as drought and flooding often make survival difficult for people living in central Africa and near the equator. These communities are often forced to undergo rehabilitation. Using AI and studying past records of casualties and assistance provided during these disasters can help gain a deeper understanding of the situation. By analyzing this data, it is possible to develop solutions to minimize the risk and damage caused by these types of disasters in the future.

## 6. Student debt crisis - *(Education)* ##
The student debt crisis has reached alarming levels in the US, with the total amount of student loan debt projected to be $1.74 trillion by 2022, surpassing the GDPs of Canada, Russia, and Australia combined. One in seven Americans have student loan debt. To find a permanent solution to this issue, AI can be used to analyze datasets from banks affiliated with colleges to identify the main causes of the crisis. Develop an AI-based solution that can mitigate the problem and provide a long-term solution for the student debt crisis.

## 7. Improved credit scoring - *(FinTech)* ## 
Conventional credit scoring methods like credit history, collateral, or any prior accounts might not give every person an equal opportunity to establish credit.
As a result, a small number of people can access basic banking services like opening a bank account and acquiring a loan. Using the pre-existing datasets, we can understand the track record of banks and the reason why conventional credit scoring is needed. Come up with an AI based solution to perform credit scoring for people who donâ€™t have any previous loans. This can be done by checking some other billing cycles theyâ€™ve been a part of and creating a scoring metrics on the basis of that.

## 8. Flagging of (AIS) INactivity Data (FIND) - *(Blue Economy)* ##
AIS is a useful system that helps to avoid ship collisions and allows managers of fleet management, especially for emergencies e.g. adverse sea conditions. Vessels keep the AIS beacons on in order to stay safe. However, sometimes the vessels do not transmit. The reasons for this may be unknown. As much as the AIS activity data are important, the inactivity data can also be put to use to understand the possible reasons behind such behavior and if needed, respond in the appropriate manner. The interactive tool should be able to categorize the AIS inactivity episodes for a single vessel or multiple vessels in a selected region. Further, the data may be classified based on the ship behavior prior to the inactivity, as well as based on various inactivity parameters such as location, time and duration of inactivity.

## 9. Online Remote Proctoring - *(Education)* ##
In online tests without proctoring, cases are often reported of impersonation and cheating. Students either ask someone else to take the test on their behalf or use methods of cheating like referring to a textbook, using smartphones or other devices to search for answers online or taking help from a friend. The two major concerns of the customer are cheating and student authentication. It ensures the candidate focuses on the test screen during the test; there is enough light in the room and checks for suspicious objects in video and background voice activity to red flag the test. It also uses face recognition to do student authentication.

## 10. Renewable Energy Access - *(Environment)* ##
In Nigeria, more than 100 million people lack reliable access to power. Many localities aren't even partially connected to the national electrical grid. The  majority of them employ costly, unreliable, noisy, and hazardous fossil fuels, which have a negative impact on the environment. The challenge partner RA 365, a recently founded Nigerian NGO, is on a mission to use AI to give funders and policymakers the resources they need to create a better future for these communities. Understand the data generation, source and usage of the area to come up with an effective solution.
